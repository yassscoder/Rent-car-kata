# Rent car Kata ðŸš— (unit testing) 

## Rules ðŸ“‹
Create a service that once it receives a user id and a car id, it creates, saves and returns a new rental item.

>- The *__user__* must have: **id and name**.
>
>- The ***car*** must have: **id, number plate and brand**.
>
>- The ***rental*** item must contain: **id, user, car and rental date**.
>
>- The rental can only be made if the car in question is not rented.

## Constraints ðŸš¨

- Do the practice with TDD
- Remember that it is a unit test of the service so if you cannot raise databases or Api Controllers.
- Solve with dependency injection the extra classes you need (Do not use Autowire)
- Use good practices such as naming (in English).
